### Writer for HTML 'human-readable' output of metadata

The HTML Metadata Record output from the mdTranslator is intended to 
be a human readable version of the metadata content read in by the 
translator.  The HTML output does not attempt mimic any established 
metadata standard but remains agnostic in its presentation. 
The HTML metadata output will display the full content of the 
metadata record ingested by the mdTranslator while translation to 
established standards may not support all fields.

The HTML output can be conveniently embedded in a users web page to 
present metadata content to visitors.
